# Order Management System - Transaction Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of the `createOrder` and `verifyOrder` methods to implement Sequelize transactions with row-level locking to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency in concurrent order processing scenarios.

## Problem Statement

The original implementation had a race condition vulnerability where multiple concurrent order requests could:

1. Read the same warehouse stock levels
2. Both determine they have sufficient stock
3. Both create orders, leading to overselling (negative stock)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Transaction Wrapping

- Wrapped the entire `createOrder` process in a Sequelize transaction
- All database operations (order creation, order items creation, stock updates) are now atomic
- If any step fails, the entire transaction is rolled back

### 2. Row-Level Locking

- Added `FOR UPDATE` clause to warehouse queries within transactions
- This locks warehouse rows during the transaction, preventing concurrent modifications
- Other transactions must wait for the lock to be released before proceeding

### 3. Double-Check Validation

- After acquiring the lock, we re-validate stock availability
- This ensures stock hasn't changed between initial verification and actual allocation

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

#### `src/services/order.service.ts`

- **Import Changes**: Added `Transaction` import from Sequelize
- **Method Signatures**: Updated methods to accept optional `Transaction` parameter
- **createOrder**: Complete rewrite using `sequelize.transaction()`
- **verifyOrder**: Updated to support transaction context
- **findOptimalWarehouses**: Added transaction parameter support
- **getWarehousesByDistance**: Added `FOR UPDATE` locking when in transaction

#### `src/models/warehouse.model.ts`

- **Import Changes**: Added `Transaction` import from Sequelize
- **updateStock**: Updated to accept optional transaction parameter

### Key Implementation Details

```typescript
// Transaction-wrapped order creation
async createOrder(orderData: CreateOrderDto): Promise<OrderResult> {
  return await sequelize.transaction(async (transaction: Transaction) => {
    // Verify order with row locking
    const verification = await this.verifyOrder(orderData, transaction);

    // Create order within transaction
    const order = await Order.create({...}, { transaction });

    // Create order items and update stock with locking
    for (const allocation of allocations) {
      // Lock warehouse row
      const warehouse = await Warehouse.findByPk(allocation.warehouseId, {
        transaction,
        lock: transaction.LOCK.UPDATE,
      });

      // Double-check stock after locking
      if (warehouse.stock < allocation.quantity) {
        throw new Error(`Insufficient stock...`);
      }

      // Update stock within transaction
      await warehouse.updateStock(allocation.quantity, transaction);
    }
  });
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. Data Consistency

- Eliminates race conditions in stock management
- Ensures atomic operations across multiple tables
- Prevents overselling scenarios

### 2. ACID Compliance

- **Atomicity**: All operations succeed or fail together
- **Consistency**: Database constraints are maintained
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- **Durability**: Committed changes are permanent

### 3. Error Handling

- Automatic rollback on any failure
- Detailed error logging with transaction context
- Graceful handling of insufficient stock scenarios

## Testing

### Concurrency Tests Added

Created `src/__tests__/concurrency.test.ts` with three test scenarios:

1. **Concurrent Orders**: Multiple simultaneous orders exceeding available stock
2. **Sequential Orders**: Rapid sequential orders depleting exact stock
3. **High Concurrency**: Many small concurrent orders testing lock contention

### Test Results

- All concurrency tests pass
- Stock levels remain consistent
- Failed orders receive appropriate error messages
- No overselling occurs under any test scenario

## Performance Considerations

### Transaction Overhead

- Slight performance impact due to locking
- Acceptable trade-off for data consistency
- Performance scales well with proper database indexing

### Lock Contention

- Locks are held for minimal time (just during stock check/update)
- READ operations (verifyOrder without transaction) remain fast
- WRITE operations are serialized for consistency

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing API endpoints work unchanged
- Response formats remain the same
- Only internal implementation changed

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Monitor transaction duration in production
2. Track lock wait times and contention
3. Alert on transaction rollback rates
4. Monitor database connection pool utilization

## Future Enhancements

1. Consider implementing optimistic locking for read-heavy scenarios
2. Add circuit breaker pattern for database resilience
3. Implement retry logic for transaction conflicts
4. Consider read replicas for non-transactional queries
